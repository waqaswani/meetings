•	Look into other sensors apart from Velostat
•	Price and Scalability should be one of the last thing on mind
•	Velostat based mat is a self-made mat but at this moment a commercial complete mat is required
•	The mat should be able to give pressure related data helpful for mental health
•	Commercial mat and Velostat based mat can be done parallelly
•	Optical fibre-based mat is difficult to scale as compared to Velostat based mat because of instability of light inside the fibre as compared to DC voltage in Velostat
